# FieldClassify

**FieldClassify** is a machine learning project aimed at understanding which features in a dataset most influence a categorical outcome. The target variable has four possible categories, and the goal is to identify patterns and relationships between input features and this classification.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Predict a categorical outcome based on multiple input features.
- Determine which features are most important for the prediction.
- Visualize and interpret feature importance using model-based and model-agnostic techniques.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
-

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
3. Evaluate performance using standard metrics.
4. Analyze and visualize which features contribute most to predictions.

---

## 📊 Output

- Ranked feature importance from trained models.
- Visual explanations using SHAP values.
- Optional: classification metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
